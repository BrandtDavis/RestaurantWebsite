        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p> This form of mining takes on different forms, some of which are more technologically advanced than others.  “Placer mining is the practise of separating heavily eroded minerals like gold from sand or gravel”(National Park Service[NPS], 2015).  This style of mining does not utilize the extraction of veins from solid rock, which is known as “hardrock mining”.  It is important to note that gold weighs more than rock and sand and this is what all methods of placer mining rely on.  To begin, gold prospectors need to “find a drainage creek that over the eons has carried gold, dust flakes, and nuggets downward to be deposited in layers of creek sediments”(NPS, 2015).  Surface material is tested using panning (explained below), or holes are made to reach the material right on top of bedrock where gold typically accumulates(NPS, 2015).  From this point, these holes are then selectively tunneled, horizontally in the direction of the most prosperous ground.  The name for this method is drift mining and the tunnels are the drifts(NPS, 2015).  This method is not very safe as there is the possibility of the tunnels collapsing, even when the ground is frozen.

        <h2> Gold Panning </h2>
        <p>
            The simplest method of placer mining is known commonly as “gold panning”, which involves combining gravel, sand , 
            and water in a prospectors pan and suspending the sand and dirt material in the water using a swirling motion.  
            Once the sand and dirt are suspended, the pan is gently dipped into a water source such as a creek or river to agitate and skim off 
            the suspended material.  This process is repeated until there are only heavier and typically finer materials left in the pan, like gold.

          <h2> An Upgrade to Panning</h2>
          <p>
            Due to its inefficient nature, the gold panning method was sped up with the use of wooden troughs known as sluice boxes (NPS, 2015).  Sluice boxes are essentially enlarged versions of a prospectors pan that utilize a water source, such as a river or a creek.  The ridges in the box help to suspend the lighter particles (dirt, sand, gravel, etc.) through agitation so they can be washed out of the box, while the heavier particles like gold will settle in the bottom.  These boxes took several forms, like compact boxes known as rockers, which relied on being rocked side to side, long-toms were another type that were more portable, saving the time and effort of building at the potential gold site (NPS, 2015).
