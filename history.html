        <h2> Background </h2>
        <p> The creation of the British Columbia we know today can be attributed in some ways to the 
          discovery of gold in the isalnds and rivers of the land that would see a massive influx of settlers
          from a variety of backgrounds.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          New Caledonia was initially settled in 1806 as a trading district for the North West Co. with a headquarters at Fort St. James, it consisted of the central and highland plateau area of modern day British Columbia (Gough, 2015).  The North West Co. was a major force in the fur trade of the area, 
          but by 1821 the company had merged with the Hudson’s Bay Company(Gough, 2015).  
        </p>

        <p>
          In the years leading up to the late 1850s, the settlement had grown to a population between 40,000-50,000.  Consisting mainly of indigenous peoples, along with some European settlers who had arrived in the late 1700’s and early 1800’s (Marshall, 2019).

        <h2> The Fraser Gold Rush </h2>
        <p>tnessed a population boom of immense proportion and diversity.
        </p>In 1856 a member of the Shuswap (presently known as Secwepemc) nation found gold in the Thompson River.  This discovery was kept a secret, but 800 ounces of gold was sent to San Francisco to be examined in February of 1957, little time was wasted by the press.  By the end of March, newspapers in Oregon and Washington had published the claims of gold being found on the Fraser River.

        The ensuing buzz around gold on the Fraser river prompted the governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Sir James Douglas to utilize his command of the West Coast and enact the Crown’s authority.  With this authority Douglas implemented a policy that gold miners were required to hold licenses.
        
        When word of the Fraser Gold Rush reached the newspapers of California, it caused an influx of ambitious miners from California to Fort Victoria.  While many of the new miners were of European descent, there was some diversity in the mass migration, including people of Hawaiian, African-American and Chinese heritage(Marshall, 2019).  Into the fall of 1858 the population had increased by 25,000, and then by 50,000 in 1859,  roughly 80% of these new miners came from California(Marshall, 2019).
        
        Overall, the impact of the Fraser Gold Rush motivated the British government to quickly  institute New Caledonia as the colony of British Columbia.

        <h2> Consequences of the Fraser Gold Rush</h2>
        <p>
          The Fraser Gold Rush had a disturbing, negative impact on the Indigenous communities of the area.  The traditional Aboriginal lands of the southern interior were swarmed by swaths of miners, many of whom showed little to no respect to the Nlaka’pamux communities (Marshall, 2019).  Mining without permission, aggressive behavior, and sexual violence against Nlaka’pamux women were some of the injustices committed by miners (Marshall, 2019).

        </p>
        <p>
          One especially significant event involved the impediment of the Nlaka’pamux salmon fishery, which was crucial to the local economy, and took place annually in the last days of summer.  Many rivers, creeks and lakes were diverted in order to help miners using placer mining techniques, and many fishing sites were taken up by miners (Marshall, 2019).  Important spawning grounds even became damaged by the disruptions, which put the entire future of the fishery at risk.

        </p>
        <p>
          Tensions however, did not ease until violence escalated.   The building pressure eventually burst, and the miners took up arms against the Nlaka’pamux in June of 1858, in what would be known as the Fraser Canyon War.  Initially, the Nlaka’pamux people had launched attacks against the miners to defend their territory after much damage had already been done.   These attacks prompted the formation of military miner groups to attack Nlaka’pamux communities (Wright, 2019).  A truce was called on August 21, 1858 and the Nlaka’pamux allowed the miners to access their lands for gold and other resources, although these permissions were granted due to the threat of continued violence.
