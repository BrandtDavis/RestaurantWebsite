        <h2> Kerr-Sulphurets-Mitchell (KSM) Mine </h2>
        <p> The gold industry is still significant in the economy of British Columbia, for instance, it has “one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in the world” (Seabridge Gold, n.d.).  This mine has a life of 55 years (estimated) and produces on average, 508,000 oz gold, with active exploration still ongoing in the year 2015.  This is the Kerr-Sulphurets-Mitchell or KSM mine, owned and operated by Seabridge Gold Inc. and is proclaimed the largest gold project in Canada (Seabridge Gold, n.d.).
